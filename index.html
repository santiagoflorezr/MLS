  Of the 704 players this season in the Major League Soccer (MLS), 451 are international players from 86 different countries. In comparison, the premier league has 245 players from 61 countries. Why are there so many players from all around the world playing in the MLS? Is it a reflection of the diversity in this country? The popularity of the sport worldwide? Or a reflection on how athletes are recruited, starting at the college level?
</p>
<p>
  The answer might be about the expectations on the quality  of competition.
</p>
<p>
  Until very recently soccer has been popular with kids, students and women (the US Women's team dominates in international competitions), but less established than other professional sports such as baseball, American football, and basketball. For Dr. Alex Gillet a Senior Lecturer at York University, who has studied the MLS growth in the last 50 years, the league “relied on importing a lot of foreign talent, occasionally sometimes entire teams, to get competition of sufficient standard to be a spectator (and televised)." The MLS historucally has needed more international players than other leagues.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand Dr Gillet explains that top players in the world want to play top 5 European leagues, (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and Spanish La Liga) as they are the most competitive and prestigious in the world.
</p>
<p>
  For hundreds of players, from all around the world, that are very talented but have no opportunity to play in the top 5 European leagues the MLS offers an excellent opportunity. Dr. Gillet recalls the case of bolivian player Jaime Moreno, who “played for a while at Middlesbrough in England where he did okay, but with limited first team opportunities. He was transferred to DC United and became a star player in MLS.” While the Premier League prefers top players from the countries that are better ranked in FIFA standings; the MLS offers the opportunity to play professionally from players from countries that do not do well on the FIFA rankings as Brad Smith Left-Back from Australia.
